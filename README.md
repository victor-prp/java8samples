This code is created for the "Fun with java 8" presenattion I gave.

'Functional programming', 'Java 8', 'Stream API', 'Lambda', 'Method reference' - are these buzz familiar to you?
In this talk I went through the basics of functional programming and explained how you can create better software using java 8 combined with functional paradigm.
The main question I tried to answer is: "Why functional is good for your code"?
I also covered some pain points that java 8 did not solve regarding functional and showed how you can workaround it.

You are welcomed to comment and/or ask any question at http://bit.ly/FunJava8­.

Tip: Each slide is marked with 'p' number (as p1, p2 etc.) this will help you to browse the code (package name) while watching the presentation.
